# Emotion Recognition Chatbot

This project, **"Text-Based Mood Detection Using Machine Learning and Emotion Identification"**, analyzes and predicts emotions from text inputs using advanced machine learning techniques. The project includes several components, such as Jupyter notebooks, a Streamlit-based web application, and a `requirements.txt` file for dependencies.

## About the Project
This project uses deep learning techniques such as **BERT embeddings** for text feature extraction, alongside traditional machine learning models (e.g., **Lasso Regression**) for emotion detection. The web interface provides users with predictions and interactive visualizations.


## Key Features
- **Emotion Detection:** Classifies text into emotions such as Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear, Love, and Surprise.
- **BERT Model:** Fine-tuned BERT for superior accuracy.
- **Interactive Interface:** Real-time predictions and visualizations via Streamlit.
- **Comprehensive Analysis:** Detailed evaluation metrics and cross-validation results.



## Dataset Information
The dataset used for training and evaluating the emotion detection models is the **[Emotion Dataset by dair.ai](https://huggingface.co/datasets/dair-ai/emotion)**, available on Hugging Face. 

### Key Features of the Dataset:
- **Text Inputs:** A collection of sentences and short texts.
- **Emotion Labels:** Six emotions - Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear, Love, and Surprise.
- **Use Case:** Ideal for text classification tasks, including emotion detection.
- **License:** Open for research and non-commercial use.
